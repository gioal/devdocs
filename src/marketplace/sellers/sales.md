All product sales in Magento Marketplace are subject to a [revenue share]({% link marketplace/sellers/revenue-share.md %}), with 70% of the revenue for the developer, and 30% for Magento. This business model allows us to invest in marketing and promotions to grow the businesses of participating developers.
