After completing development, testing, and creating a new extension entry, you can submit your extension for [Technical]({% link marketplace/sellers/submit-for-technical-review.md %}) and [Marketing]({% link marketplace/sellers/submit-for-marketing-review.md %}) review. The extension enters a queue when submitted. We will review your extension code and submitted information according to the queue, sending feedback and confirmation by email. Track the status and progress of your extension submission through your Marketplace account. Our [Extension Quality Program]({% link marketplace/sellers/extension-quality-program.md %}) (EQP) verifies that all Marketplace extensions meet Magento quality standards and best practices.

Prior to submitting your extension for review, add it to your account extensions. See [Creating a New Extension]({% link marketplace/sellers/extension-information.md %}).

[Submit for Technical Review]({% link marketplace/sellers/submit-for-technical-review.md %}) when you are ready to have Magento Marketplace review the code and technical aspects of your extension. These steps require additional information for your extension including a PDFÂ guide, supported Magento versions, and code package.

[Submit for Marketing Review]({% link marketplace/sellers/submit-for-marketing-review.md %}) when you are ready to have Magento Marketplace review the marketing content.

You must complete both a technical and marketing review to fully list your extension on the Magento Marketplace. The following diagram details the process of submissions and reviews.
